# RayTracer
## Why?
This is a toy project to...
- further brush up my skills in computer graphics and
- try to learn C++.

As such, this project is not intended to fulfill an actual purpose outside the aforementioned ones and may (nay, will)
contain bugs, inaccuracies, bad practices and general nastiness. If you don't mind these limitations, have fun!

## How?
This project requires...
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [libPNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

Both are available from [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/).

Provide a config file in the same format as [config.cfg](config.cfg) as a command line parameter to specify the scene to use.

## What?
The current result is as follows:
